# Simple copy of Jetty Boot
## Requirements
The ```pygame``` library provides the tools for the core functionality of the game. For the intended looks, installing the ```JetBrains Mono``` font is highly recommended
## The game
This is a replica of the arcade game located in the "Space Rig" part of Deep Rock Galactic. Physics are kind of flaky, but it isn't intended to be perfect as the goal of this project is making the game playable, not impeccable.
